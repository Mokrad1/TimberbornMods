# Global Market

Finding it annoying having to setup trading routes between districts? Worry no more! Now just plop down a Global Market and your beavers will have a shared building to store all their items. The items "will be transported via the Air Balloon service" so all items are available anywhere via a GlobalMarket!

## How to use

The Global Market can be found under the storage tab. 

### Use as decoration

It is possible to use this block as pure decoration by disabling the inventory. That way you just have a cute marketplace with a airballoon flying around!

## Installing

Recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). You can install this plugin manually by cloning the repo, building it and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).

## Problems?

In case you experience problems, message me in the modding channel of the the [Timberborn discord](https://discord.gg/mfbBF4cWpX) or message me directly (Tobbert#1607). I will try to fix it as soon as possible. :D
