# Ladder

This mod will allow you to build ladders. Ladders will make it so your beavers can go straight up and down without having to build a large stairwell.

## Shoutout

A massive shoutout to TheBloodEyes for helping the navigation fix be as optimized as can be!

## How to use

You will find the ladder under the paths tab.
