## Adding a new cursor

You can add a new cursor following these steps:
1. create a new directory in the Cursors folder.
2. Add an image to the directory that you just created.
3. (Optionally) Add a second image that will be used when you are dragging the camera. **Make sure this images has a name that comes after the first image (see Wood Cursor as an example).**
4. The cursor should now be visible in the settings menu and you can select it by click it.
5. Enjoy your own cursor! (And maybe share them with me, because I would love to see them! :D)
