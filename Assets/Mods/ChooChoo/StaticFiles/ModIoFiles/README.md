# ChooChoo

After working on this mod for about 2 months it is finally available. The ChooChoo mod! This mod adds trains to Timberborn which can pick up goods from stations and deliver them elsewhere. 
The mod features a custom Track System that is fairly optimised and shouldn't impact performance that much. Trains can hold many items and as such trains are very good at delivering goods to remote districts. 

## How to use

The mod as a new group to the bottom bar that has all buildings and tracks related to the trains. To unlock the buildings, you have to unlock the Train Yard building. 

### Track system

To make trains move, they need tracks of course! You can build tracks just like normal paths would. The trains won't be able to turn around, so make sure the train layout has possible ways for the train to turn around!

### Trains

Trains are created in the Train Yard. 

### Goods Stations

Goods stations are where beavers can give items to be picked up by trains and be delivered in other Goods Stations. 

## Installing

Recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). You can install this plugin manually by cloning the repo, building it and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).
